--For this project, I used data from Spotify's top 50 songs in 2021 to answer the below questions

--Which artist made the top 10 according to popularity?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--Which artist appeared the most on the list?

SELECT artist_name, count (artist_name) AS artist_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name 
ORDER BY count(artist_name)desc
LIMIT 1;

--How many songs are written in C Major?

SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE song_key = 0
AND song_mode = 1
ORDER BY artist_name asc;

--What are the top 10 happiest dance songs?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, valence, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY valence DESC, tempo desc
LIMIT 10;

--What is the most common key?

SELECT song_key, count(song_key) as key_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY song_key
ORDER BY count(song_key) desc
LIMIT 1;

--Which songs have a tempo over 100 and dance-ability over 0.5?

SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo > 100
AND danceability > 0.5;

--Using a CTE, find the average popularity of the artists, and list any with 90 or above

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name, average_popularity,
"Top Star" AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
