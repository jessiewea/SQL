LIMIT 1;

SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE song_key = 0
AND song_mode = 1
ORDER BY artist_name asc;

SELECT track_name, artist_name, valence, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY valence DESC, tempo desc
LIMIT 10;

FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

ORDER BY count(song_key) desc
LIMIT 1;
